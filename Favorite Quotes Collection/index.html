        <h2>What is a Quote?</h2>
        <p>Quote is to repeat words that someone else has <strong>said or written.</strong> Quotes are important because they add credibility, support arguments, provide clarity, 
            and <strong>offer inspiration or emotional resonance</strong>. They can also enhance the impact of writing or speech by incorporating the insights of others. Quotes from experts or 
            established sources can strengthen your own arguments and add weight to your claims.
            They demonstrate that you've done your research and are drawing on established knowledge. Quotes can serve as <strong>concrete examples or evidence </strong>to support your points, making your writing or presentation more convincing. 
            They allow you to present the perspectives of others directly, rather than relying solely on your own interpretation. </p>
