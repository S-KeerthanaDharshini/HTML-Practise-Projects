    <h2>Biography of Mary Kom</h2>
    <p>An Olympic medallist and six-time world champion,<strong> Mary Kom </strong> is an unrefuted boxing legend.
Born into a poor farming family in Manipur, Mangte Chungneijang ‘Mary’ Kom was a gifted athlete from childhood. However, she decided to switch to boxing inspired by fellow <strong>Manipuri Dingko Singh’s</strong> gold medal win at the 1998 Asian Games held in Bangkok.
Her ambition to become a successful boxer saw Mary leave home at the age of 15 to train at the <strong>Imphal Sports Academy</strong>.
She also had to keep her boxing training a secret from her father Mangte Tonpa Kom, an ex-wrestler, who was initially not too keen on her daughter pursuing a combat sport.
Tonpa would come to know about Mary’s secret once her photo was published in the newspapers after she became a state champion in 2000. Having gradually won her father over, MC Mary Kom would go on to conquer the world.</p>
