        <h1 style="text-align:center">My Favorite Subject: Science</h1>
        <p>Science is about defining how the things work with proofs.It is further divided 
            into subfields like Biology,Zoology,Physics,Chemistry and many
             more.Among the distinct field <strong>Biology</strong> is my favorite which deals with the habitat and science of growth of the flora.</p>
        <h2>Why Biology ?</h2>
             <p>As one of my hobbies are plant parenting which is about caring the plants 
            that is in both indoors or outdoors throught out the growth by watering
             ,cleaning off dusts from the leaves, providing nourshing foods to the plant.</p>
        <h2>Achievement Through Learning !</h2>
         <p>Learning of the plant growth helped me to care the plants in the scientific way such as understanding the
             level of watering, exposure to sunlight, adding up the natural fertilizers to boost the immunity of the plant.</p>
             <h2>My Final thoughts!</h2>
             <ul>
                <li>Actually growing plants indoors will help us keep refreshed all the time.</li>
                <li>Gives a positive state of mind.</li>
                <li>Purifies the air around us.</li>
                <li>Maintains the room temperature as humid .<strong> Heavenly like feel during summers.</strong></li>
             </ul>
