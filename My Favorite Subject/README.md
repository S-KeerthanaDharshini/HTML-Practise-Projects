# Project 2: My Favorite Subject 

This is the second project in my HTML Foundation Series.  
It is a simple HTML-only web page that presents an essay about my favorite academic subject.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project helped me practice:
- Writing clean, semantic HTML  
- Organizing content using paragraphs and headings  
- Linking to external resources using the `<a>` tag  
- Structuring an essay-like layout using only HTML
