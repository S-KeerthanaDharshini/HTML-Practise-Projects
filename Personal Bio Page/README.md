# Project 1:Personal Bio Page 

This is a beginner-level HTML project that introduces who I am.

It includes:
- My name and a brief introduction
- My age, hobbies, and educational background
- A list of interests and a photo

This project is built using only HTML as part of my foundation-building journey in web development.
